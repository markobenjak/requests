## Task
You must write an HTTP service that 
- receives requests generated by our collector
- check the validity of each request
- reject invalid requests
- count and store statistics per customer per hour
Your code should contain a stub function to which you should pass all valid requests.

The service must also provide
- an endpoint to get the statistics
  - for a specific customer 
  AND
  - a specific day
The response must also contain the total number of requests for that day.

### Requests considered as invalid are:
* malformed JSON
* missing one or more fields
* with a customer ID not found in the database or for a customer which is disabled
* with a remote IP address which is in the blacklist
* with a user agent which is in the blacklist

### The stats table will contain:
* one entry per hour and per customer ID
* the `request_count` column contains the number of valid requests
* the `invalid_count` column will be used for the number of invalid requests
